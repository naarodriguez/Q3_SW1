			A film called 20th Century Girl is set in the 1980s. The movie is about a girl named Na Bo-Ra who had a bestfried named Kim Yeon-du. Due to a heart illness, her best friend needed to travel to the United States for surgery so she could keep getting well. Before the best friend left, they used diaries or email accounts to stay in touch, and the only thing her friend wanted was to find the guy she once ran into. Na Bo-Ra started looking for the boy in school since she wanted to fulfill her promise before her friend returns. She is fortunate that the guy is a schoolmate, and she soon discovered his name is Baek Hyun-Jin. She began to follow the boy every day, gathering facts about him to record in her diary. She gradually develops feelings for Hyun-best Jin's friend Poong Woon-Ho. While Woon-Ho begins to hang out with her more, Hyun-Jin makes friends with her. Bo-Ra begins to develop feelings for Woon-Ho and forgets about her goal to find out more about Hyun-Jin, but Woon-Ho is also beginning to develop feelings for Bo-Ra. After some time has gone and Yeon-Du has returned, Yeon-Du caught up with Bo-Ra and they chatted about the boy she was looking for. It turned out that Woon-ho, not Hyun-Jin, was the guy she had been looking for all along. Bo-Ra was stunned and wanted to keep her feelings for Woon-Ho a secret so she wouldn't upset Yeon-Du. Due to Woon-Ho's soon departure for the United States, the four of them hung around until Yeon-du observed the bond between Woon-Ho and Bo-Ra. Yeon-Du confronts Bo-Ra on their way home, and the two get into a quarrel. Yeon-Du calms down and accepts her fate, while Bo-Ra is left in a difficult scenario where her boy bestfriend is leaving and her girl bestfriend is upset. On the day of Woon-Ho's departure, Bo-Ra was told to follow him to the train station, where they confessed their feelings to one another. Through the internet, they were still able to communicate with one another when Woon-Ho was in the US, and a few months later, it was New Year's Eve. As soon as the clock hit 12 midnight, Bo-Ra sent Woon-Ho a message, but she received no reply. It had been a very long time since he had spoken to her, which left her feeling disappointed and wanting to forget about him. Many years later, she received an invitation to event of art or video films. As she was browsing the video art, she recognized a video tape that was playing on the screen. As the film wraps up, she recalled the place of their first unforgettable experience together and was surprised to learn that Woon-Ho had made the tape and had dedicated it to her.She realized that Woon-Ho died before the 20th century simply by reading the credit line. To conclude the story , the movie is about a girl who fell in love with a guy and their relationship lasted up till the last month of the 19th century, but unfortunately the guy never even had the opportunity to meet the girl in the 20th century.
